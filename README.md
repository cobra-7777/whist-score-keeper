# Whist Score Keeper

Whist Score Keeper is a program created in Python, to help you keep track of the scores in your Whist games. Whist has a pretty complicated scoring system, which is why this program was created, to help speed up the process and make it easier to keep scores of your games. For now, it only supports 4-player Whist, or "Partner Whist/Auction Whist" as its also called. There are plans to support 3-player Whist as well.


## Features of Whist Score Keeper

- Dark UI - Easy on the eyes.
- Automatic score keeping for Whist games.
- Keeps track of how many hands have been played, and stops at 12.
- After a player wins, a "Star" is awarded, allowing you to keep playing while tracking how many wins each player has.
- Keeps track of the "Stars" of each player.
- Dynamic saving/loading functionality allows you to take a break from a game whenever you want, and load it right back up whenever youre ready to resume.
