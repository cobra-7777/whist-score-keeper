# Whist Score Keeper

Whist Score Keeper is a program created in Python, to help you keep track of the scores in your Whist games. Whist has a pretty complicated scoring system, which is why this program was created, to help speed up the process and make it easier to keep scores of your games. For now, it only supports 4-player Whist, or "Partner Whist/Auction Whist" as its also called. There are plans to support 3-player Whist as well.


## Features of Whist Score Keeper

- Dark UI - Easy on the eyes.
- Automatic score keeping for Whist games.
- Keeps track of how many hands have been played, and stops at 12.
- A "Star" system that awards a star for each win. Once you win 12 stars, you receive a crown, and stars reset.
- A "Crown" system that awards a crown for each 12 games won. When 12 of one crown (bronze for example) has been earned, the crown is upgraded (to silver for example). This system is mainly to make sure a game can go on "forever".
- Dynamic saving/loading functionality allows you to take a break from a game whenever you want, and load it right back up whenever youre ready to resume.
- See the history of each game in nicely formatted table
- Shuffle player order around to switch up who starts as dealer/caller (Can only be done at the start of a game.)
- Ability to revert the latest round played, in case of type errors when completing the round.
